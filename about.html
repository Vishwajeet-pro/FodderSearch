                    <p>We have a vision of creating a platform which can be used by the people, who wants to support our society and wants to carry their social responsibility. It is not for money and we don't want to introduce money into the entire process. Only the persons willing to play a role in saving the environment from the garbage. Which is garbage for one but fodder for others. This nice thought should be rewarded as well for which we have chosen the genuine product that one produces by using the fodder.</p>
